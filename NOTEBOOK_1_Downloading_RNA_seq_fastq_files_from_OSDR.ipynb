        "In this notebook, we will be downloading data from [OSD-104](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-104). This dataset includes [transcriptomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome) data that were collected during the NASA [Rodent Research 1 mission (RR1)](https://nlsp.nasa.gov/view/lsdapub/lsda_experiment/7633383e-fe88-5ada-92dd-cd31a50fda32).\n",

        "\n",
        "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project advances biomedical research on spaceflightâ€™s physiological effects. With limited ISS resources, efficient crew time use is vital. GeneLab enhances RR value by applying multi-omics approaches and sharing data openly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The OSD-104 study was part of a [SpaceX-4 mission](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/missions/SpaceX-4) that started on September 21, 2014 and ended October 25, 2014. There were several biological payloads on this mission, including rodents, fruit flies, plants, and yeast. This data is stored in the [Ames Life Science Data Archive](https://techport.nasa.gov/projects/145035).\n",

        "The primary objective of this notebook is to download 2 FASTQ files (one for each paired end reads of a single sample). In subsequent notebooks, we will use this downloaded data to perform quality checking, alignment, and quantification. You can read more about FASTQ files in this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the free use of Google Drive has a [15GB limit](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9312312?hl=en), we have to pay careful attention to how much space we use in the labs. We provide a Python method which reduces the number of records in the FASTQ files by a configurable factor. Removing good records from a FASTQ file is not something one would normally do, but we are doing it in these labs so that you can go through all the steps to see how it is done and, at the same time, stay under the 15GB storage limit.\n",
